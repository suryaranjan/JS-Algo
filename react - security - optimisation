security steps for react
1. avoid using dangerouslySetHttml - it can lead to xss attack as it gives direct access to setting html without verifying anything
2. sanitize input - before rendering and sending to server sanitize or verify properly
use tools like DOMpurify for sanitize and zod yup for validation
3. do not put sesitive information in .env file like client id and key
4. authorization and authentication 
5. https - to make sure encrytion for communications and cors - to make sure no unauthorised website can acces it, for cross browser communication for rest api
6. csp - content security policy - added on http response header from server.


optimisation
1. code splitting
2. lazy loading
3. virtualisation-  loading data only visible in view pprt - react window, react-virtualisation
4. memoization
5. check in profile dev tool- for unnecessery rerendwrs
6. performance tool - for component to take more time for loading
7. debounce and throttle
